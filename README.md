###### ruby_teatimer

I often find myself working in the command line, and have no desire to move away from what I'm working on just to monitor my tea. Hence the quick write-up of this software. When the program is executed it will allow you to pick builder's tea, Oolong, or green tea. Steep times are 5 minutes, 4 minutes, and 3 minutes respectively. Changing those times and/or adding new teas is trivial.

This software does nothing exciting, and there are no bells or whistles. It simply tells you that the tea is steeping, sleeps for the selected amount of time, and then displays a message when the tea is finished.

Usage:

*ruby teatimer.rb&*
